Todd
Okay, this is Todd. 

Anne
This is Anne. 

Todd
And we are going to talk about a problem that Anne wants to solve, which is about property management. Anne, why don't you give us an overview of your situation. So tell us the properties that you own and describe each of them. 

Anne
Okay, there are over half a dozen properties, and I'm trying to keep track of all of the providers at each property, like electricians and carpenters, and also all of the bill paying, such as utilities, associated with each property. 

Todd
And let's go through each property. So let's go through one by one and just describe the property. So don't talk about the problems or anything with it. Just give me the facts on each property that you own right now and just a quick overview of the property. 

Anne
Okay. There are three properties in Vermont. There's a large main house, a guest house, and a piece of land with a house that's about to be torn down. Okay. There are two condos in New York City that are next to each other. 

Todd
And that's, what, 34 North 7th and Brooklyn, right? 

Anne
Yes. 

Todd
And describe those just briefly. What are they like? 

Anne
They are each around 2,000 square feet. They adjoin through a balcony and a shared roof deck. 

Todd
Great. Next property. Let's do Vermont. 

Anne
Can I pause for a second? 

Todd
Okay. Let's talk about Vermont. 

Anne
We already did Vermont. Oh, yeah. No, I'm doing Rhode Island. 

Todd
Oh, Rhode Island. You're right. 

Anne
has a large single-family home about 3,500 square feet. There's also a condo in Martinique and a condo in Paris and a house in San Jose, California. Yeah and 

Todd
then I have a house which I own but we probably want to put under this as well and that's 125 Dana Avenue in San Jose. So those are all of the properties and And to be clear, Ann's just a private owner, not looking to start a property management business. It's just that, tell me if I'm right, the day-to-day of managing these properties is just a huge pain. And that's what you're trying to get on top of, right? 

Anne
Yes. Keeping track of gas, electric, plumbing, property taxes, insurance needs, etc. 

Todd
So let's talk through some of the problems that you've been having that you want to solve. You were talking about problems with property tax payments, right? Talk to me about that. 

Anne
Every town has its own schedule of property tax payments. So right now I have a calendar system for those. But one of them, we sent a check, and then it turned out they didn't get the check, so they fined us. So I need a system not only for keeping track of what the amounts and when they're due, but also making sure that the payments have gone through. 

Todd
And get specific on that. That was Dummerton, which is Vermont? 

Anne
That was Brattleboro, Vermont. 

Todd
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so what was the specific issue with that? It sounded like Bank of America said they sent the check. 

Anne
Yeah, we sent a check through Bank of America, which sends a paper check, but apparently they didn't send the check or somehow the people did not receive the check and we had to resend it. 

Todd
So it would be good if this system could somehow confirm that a check was cashed and tell you if after a reasonable amount of time it wasn't, right? 

Anne
Yes. And some of the property taxes are paid in that way. Some are paid online. It's all different for each one. 

Todd
Yeah. So to be clear, we've got Dummerston, Vermont. Dummerston. Dummerston, Vermont, that is. We have got... And Brattleboro. We've got Brattleboro. Yep. And then we also have the New York properties are in Brooklyn. And then we have Martinique, which is technically France, which is a whole other thing. And then we have Paris, France. And then we also have the San Jose property, which is Santa Clara County in California. So it sounds like, yeah, tracking all the property taxes and also tracking payments to those. And then you also had a payment problem just recently also with Bank of America with a vendor. 

Anne
Yes, it seems like Bank of America's checks aren't going out very reliably. 

Todd
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's talk about some of your other challenges. What are the other day-to-day challenges that you've got with managing all these? 

Anne
um one that just happened was even though our fuel oil in vermont is on some kind of schedule the fuel tank ran completely out and the heating stopped working and it was freezing cold 

Todd
in the house and so i'm thinking a couple other things there would have been nice to know 

Anne
that the house was cold from like i knew that from nest okay that's how i found out i got a 

Todd
warning from Nest. But it'd be nice to have that automated, right? So maybe the system could also track home automation type of things. Maybe it could let you know. It'd be nice if that tank had 

Anne
automation rather than the company just saying they would fill it when needed because obviously 

Todd
that doesn't work. Yeah, that would be interesting to explore. Okay. Yeah, as many things automated 

Anne
as possible would be great. Yeah. Especially in Vermont, I'd say are the properties that are used 

Todd
the least yeah and yeah so if there are leaks and things you pretty much got webcams everywhere right so rhode island but i can't see a lot of them sometimes but rhode island has that um hick vision system that you put in yeah and then you've got nest cameras i think everywhere else somewhere 

Anne
yeah we don't have any in martinique or paris okay and then i've got uh 125 dana 

Todd
has a Mac-based system called Security Spy that I use for security cameras. What other technology do we have around? You've got Nest thermostats in most places. Yes. I've got an Echobee thermostat. 

Anne
And we have a Lutron system in Brooklyn. 

Todd
Oh, yeah. That's mainly for running-- 

Anne
And that all works remotely, and that works well remotely. 

Todd
Yep, yep. Let's talk about some of the other challenges that you've got that you're looking to solve. It sounds like having some sort of maintenance schedule kind of thing would be useful. - Yes. - And then almost all your communication with people is over email, right? And that's your ann@annsfalter.com. Is that Google mail? Where's that hosted? 

Anne
- Yeah, it's Gmail. 

Todd
- So it'd be nice to have something that could read your emails and look for property management related things and be able to put that into the system as a monitor, right? Sure. What else? What other challenges do you have in the place? I know we recently had that water alarm go off in Rhode Island. Yeah, but there was water. And we happened to be home, but obviously some sort of critical notification if nobody was home that would reach out and make sure you do. 

Anne
Yeah, that is connected to our alarm system. So in Rhode Island, there's a full monitored alarm system, and they work down a call list. They call us, and we have a construction company that helps oversee the house, and they have an emergency number, so they can come and address anything like that. In Vermont, we have a couple that lives nearby and helps oversee the house, but don't do the best job and are not really, I think, interested in doing that job. But it's been impossible to find anyone else. So we actually have the Rhode Island Construction Company now coming to Vermont four times a year to work on projects there. 

Todd
Wow. What else? What else is a day-to-day hassle that you've got with keeping track of the houses? 

Anne
Each house has different cleaning people, so keeping track of that and making sure that they're doing a good job. 

Todd
Yeah, and I've got cleaning at San Jose as well. 

Anne
Vermont has a whole issue with land use, so we just worked through a complicated thing, the properties into the land use program i don't think that comes up again for another 10 or 20 years though so that's probably not a big deal all the properties have landscaping except for san jose 

Todd
yep um you know um well we've got joel uh doing at least true right yeah we do have a basic land yeah there um and it sounds like too um what and i'm putting words in your mouth but it would also be nice to have kind of a general inventory of everything that we'd advise. So like for example in San Jose I know my roof is old and really is at the point that we should think about replacing it. And I think for everything it would just be nice to know how old are the windows. Upcoming expenses. And you just had the issue, actually that's a good point, you just had the issue in New York where you had to spend a lot of money on replacing all of the air conditioning units which turned out to be 20 years old and so it would be nice if the system would track and maybe look at best practices and I don't know maybe a monthly report or a quarterly report or something that would say hey you know as you're planning for the next year here's some things to keep in mind the air conditioning is old it's time to start thinking about replacing it the roof is old it's time to to start thinking about replacing it. 

Anne
Yeah, like a maintenance and repair schedule. And we have to replace the roof in the main house in Vermont. So that's going to be a huge project. There's a lot of big projects actually coming up in Vermont.   Todd
And so you were talking about bill pay and the challenges with bill pay. 

Anne
Yeah, so there's also a bookkeeper involved. And most of the bills are paid auto pay through Bank of America. And the bookkeeper is helping keep track of insurance payments, property tax payments, and things like that. But sometimes things fall through the cracks. 

Todd
So she operates via email? So like when a bill gets paid, does she email you? 

Anne
No. 

Todd
She just pays them. They go to her. How do you know what she did? 

Anne
I only really know what she did when something goes awry. 

Todd
Interesting. 

Anne
You know, so like I got in the mail a fine from Brattleboro, Vermont, saying that we had failed to pay our property tax. And it turns out she had sent the check to Bank of America, but somehow they never received it, and we had to send a second one. 

Todd
And how do you let her know what to pay? Is it voice? 

Anne
I scan in a lot of the bills we can auto pay through the bank. So we set that up. And then she has access to our checking account. Sometimes we get bills in the mail, and I scan them with Adobe Scan and then send her a PDF. 

Todd
Great. And that would be in your annnspalter.com account as well? 

Anne
Yes. 

Todd
Great. Great. Any other accounts that pay stuff that you'd want to monitor besides Bank of America? 

Anne
Hang on one second. Yes, taxes, insurance. 

Todd
But besides, the only account you pay bills out of is Bank of America, right? Generally. 

Anne
Yes, generally. Yeah, okay. That is the main one. 

Todd
Yeah. I think that's pretty good. anything else in terms of a day-to-day challenge you know a problem that you have that you wish the system could fix for you okay and then one more piece of property is all the cars right yeah so let's go through all the cars that 

Anne
everybody owns there are five cars or there do you want to do seven well we should definitely do mine as well yeah so there's seven there are seven cars um a 2013 chevy traverse a 2023 black equinox 2018 green equinox 2023 dodge charger 2025 ford explorer 

Todd
a 2013 yellow Camaro and a 2019 beige Honda CRV and they all need insurance and repairs 

Anne
our five of the cars are registered in Rhode Island and don't have any taxes associated with 

Todd
them anymore. Yeah and the 2019 CRV is in San Jose and the 2013 Camaro is also in San Jose. Yeah I think that's about it. What about does everything have a mortgage or are they paid for? 

Anne
The two condos in Brooklyn are next to each other. One is PH2F and one is PH2E and the ph2f unit has a mortgage okay and then um 125 dana in san jose is paid off 

Todd
but probably needs financing to settle a divorce payment to my ex and so that it should be set up definitely to track uh financing on that and what about the cars cars all paid for yeah financing yeah all the cars are paid for. All right anything else come to mind in terms of problems that you're hitting day to day? Great let's talk just a little bit about how you operate. You live on your MacBook Pro which is pretty much with you at all times and you have a iPhone which is certainly with you at all times And then same for me Have a Mac that's almost always with me and an iPhone that's almost always with me. I think from Anne's perspective It would be good to be able to certainly enter information from anywhere So, you know, she's out and gets a call and some sort of maintenance things needs to be done It would be great to be able to capture that information no matter where she's at. I think, you know, and beyond that. 

Anne
It would be great to be able to generate reports that show, you know, over time, how much are we spending on each of these properties. 

Todd
Yeah. So like some sort of maintenance logging system, total expense system. 

Anne
Yeah. 

Todd
Probably the same for the cars as well, to be able to track car maintenance, car problems, things like that. Great. alright
